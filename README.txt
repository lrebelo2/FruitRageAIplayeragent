The	Fruit	Rage! a	game	that	captures	the	nature	of	a	zero	sum	two	player	game	with	
strict	limitation	on	allocated	time	for	reasoning.


The	Fruit	Rage	is	a	two	player	game	in	which	each	player	tries	to	maximize	his/her	share	from	a	
batch of	fruits randomly	placed	in	a	box.	The	box	is	divided	into	cells	and	each	cell	is	either	empty	
or	filled	with	one	fruit	of	a	specific type.

In	this game,	no	fruit	is	added	during	game	
play.	Hence,	players	play	until	all	fruits	have	been	claimed.
